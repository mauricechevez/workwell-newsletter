                            Are you being sabotaged by self-doubt? Recently overheard while hiding in the back row of a Soul Cycle  üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  class - "Doubts will have more of your dreams than you will if you let it." This hit hard, and I started thinking about all the opportunities I turned away or chances that passed by because discounting myself was less painful than letting somebody else potentially do it first. If you can think of any of those times too (even just one), here's an <a href="https://money.com/self-doubt-at-work-strategies/" target="_blank">article</a> on how to overcome the different types of doubt holding you back.

                         Focus on the positive (even if there's a negative). Have a running note of all the good things that have happened and what you've achieved so you can look back at where you've come from. It'll set you up nicely for when you need to update your resume or looking for behavioral answers for interviews.
